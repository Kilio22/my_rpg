This project is the most important one in C_Graphical programming during first year at epitech. Enjoy !      



This project is one of the freest project of your first year. Create your own **RPG**.  
Your main challenge for this game will be to create a complete product using everything that you and your
team know.  
Your game must follow the following rules:  
 - The player needs to have characteristics which you can find in the status menu.  
 - The player can fight enemies, statistics will impact the fights results.  
 - There must be NPC in your game.  
 - You need to implement at least one quest.  
 - The player must have an inventory which can contain a limited set of items.  
 - The player can earn experience by winning fights and accomplishing specific actions.  
 - With enough experience, the player can level up, upgrading its statistics.    

To give the users the feeling that you’re delivering a complete product you need to polish as much as possible
your game.    

 - Having a pleasant user interface.  
 - Create a coherent universe (visual assets, audio assets, scenario, . . .)  
 - Create a funny game where the player has at least one goal.  
 - Create a game with a beginning and an end
